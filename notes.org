* Notes
REST:
- REST: Representational State Transfer
- Basically a standard that makes it easier for developers to determine how routes are handled
- Maps HTTP methods to their CRUD (Create Read Update Delete) actions

REST Conventions Table:
|------------+-----------------+-------------+----------------------------------------|
| Route Name | URL Path        | HTTP Method | Purpose                                |
|------------+-----------------+-------------+----------------------------------------|
| Index      | /object         | GET         | Display list of all objects            |
| New        | /object/new     | GET         | Offers form to create new object       |
| Create     | /object         | POST        | Creates new object on server           |
| Show       | /object:id      | GET         | Displays one specific object's details |
| Edit       | /object:id/edit | GET         | Offers form to edit specific object    |
| Update     | /object:id      | PATCH       | Updates specific object on server      |
| Destroy    | /object:id      | DELETE      | Deletes specific object                |
|------------+-----------------+-------------+----------------------------------------|

NOTE:
- By using a 'resource' method within 'config/routes.rb', we generate ALL 7 of the REST routes above.

You can check this out yourself by running 'rails routes' within this lesson's directory, and pipe the results into grep:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-lecture-videos-rest/pet-shop $ rails routes | grep "pets"
The dependency tzinfo-data (>= 0) will be unused by any of the platforms Bundler is installing for. Bundler is installing for ruby but the dependency is only for x86-mingw32, x86-mswin32, x64-mingw32, java. To add those platforms to the bundle, run `bundle lock --add-platform x86-mingw32 x86-mswin32 x64-mingw32 java`.
                              pets_index GET    /pets/index(.:format)                                                                             pets#index
                                    pets GET    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#index
                                new_pets GET    /pets/new(.:format)                                                                               pets#new
                               edit_pets GET    /pets/edit(.:format)                                                                              pets#edit
                                         GET    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#show
                                         PATCH  /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#update
                                         PUT    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#update
                                         POST   /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#create
#+end_src

You can also use the 'only:' option to limit the amount of routes present as well, so I modified the 'config/routes.rb' file with the following contents:
#+begin_src ruby
Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # Using basic 'http' verb + URL + method pattern:
  get 'pets/index'
  resources :shops
  # Define your application routes per the DSL in https://guides.rubyonrails.org/routing.html
  get "pets", to: "pets#index"
  # Using 'resource' keyword with just 1 of 7 various REST method options
  # NOTE: Commented out for lesson
  # resource :pets, only: [:show, :create, :new, :edit, :update]
  resource :pets, only: [:index, :show]

  # Defines the root path route ("/")
  # root "articles#index"
end
#+end_src

This then changed the corresponding 'rails routes | grep "pets"' related output accordingly:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-4/phase-4-lecture-videos-rest/pet-shop $ rails routes | grep "pets"

                              pets_index GET    /pets/index(.:format)                                                                             pets#index
                                    pets GET    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#index
                                         GET    /pets(.:format)                                                                                   pets#show
#+end_src
